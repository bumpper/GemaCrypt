1:1	According to the God-spoken wordc which says: "When you heard of wars and rumors of wars, nation will fight against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, earthquakes, plagues and deviationsf of stars, 
1:2	Then the bush which restrains the sons of Hagar1 1 will dry up. 
1:3	And three sons of Hagar will go forth into great Babylonia, (whose) name(s are) Ouaches, and anotherk Axiaphar, and the third Morphosar. 
1:4	And Ishmael will come down1 the region of the land of swift passage. 
1:5	And he will establish his camp in Chalcedon across from Byzantium. 
1:6	And the other one will come to Antioch, Cilicia, and Iberian Anatolia, the Thrakysan country and Smyrna" and as far as the Seven-hilled (city). 
1:7	And he will spill Roman blood. 
1:8	And another will come to the region of Persia and (to) the Galilean country, the Armenian border, and the city of frebizond. 
1:9	And he will come to the region of the land of the Meropes. 
1:10	And he will massacre male children from two and three years old and younger. 
1:11	And he will consume them by the sword. 
1:12	And the third one" will come down the regions of the northv and Mesiaspolisw and Synopolis, and Zalichos, the regions of Chrysiapetra, and the well-lit valley and Bithynia, and of Daphnousia, Chrysioupolis, and Damoulion and as far as the Seven-hilled (city).
2:1	And therefore all these (will) slaughter an infinite multitude of Romans from two and three years olda and younger. 
2:2	And they will gather together toward the sea. 
2:3	And in their shipsc (will be) a myriad myriads. 
2:4	And there will be other infinite and innumerable multitudes. 
2:5	And in that place many will deny our Lord Jesus Christ and the holy gifts and will follow the apostates. 
2:6	And every sacrifice will cease from the churches. 
2:7	And the liturgy of God will be mocked. 
2:8	And the priests will be as laymen. 
2:9	And Ishmael will cry out with a great voice, boasting and saying, 
2:10	'"Where is the God of the Romans? There is no one helping them, for we have defeated them completely." 
2:11	For trulyh the three sons of Hagar will roar' against the Romans. 
2:12	And they will cross over against the Seven-hilled (city) toward Byzantium. 
2:13	And conferring, they will say (among) themselves, 
2:14	"Come and let us make a bridge in the seaj with boats and transport* horses for ourselves to Byzantium, the Seven-hilled (city)." 
2:15	But the rulers of the Romans and the magnates of the Seven-hilled (city) will flee to the glens of the mountains.1 
2:16	And there will be fear and affliction. 
2:17	And there will be much necessity of the mountains." 
2:18	And the people of the Seven-hilled (city) will be afflicted by the sword. 
2:19	Woe, woe then.  
2:20	How will the orthodox faith of the Christians and the invincible power of the honorable and life-giving cross be overcome?" 
3:1	But hear, brethren, that because of their iniquity God forbears. 
3:2	And the first will set up his couch across from Byzantium. 
3:3	And he will strike and they will be stricken. 
3:4	And then the rulers of the Romans blaspheme, saying, 
3:5	"Woe, woe, neither ina heaven do we have a kingb nor on the earth." 
3:6	And with this word the Lord will incline his mercy toward the Romans and toward their revenge and will repayd justice to his enemies. 
3:7	And there will be a great sound from heaven and a fearful earthquake and a voice from the angel from heaven. 
3:8	And the Lord will incline his head and will set his furye against the sons of Hagar and upon the feet of Ishmael. 
3:9	And the Lord will lift up the cowardice of the Romans and putg (it) into the hearts of Ishmael, and the courage of the Ishmaelites into the hearts of the Romans. 
3:10	And the Lord will raise up a king of the Romans, who people say is dead and useful for nothing, who people thinkh died many years before.' 
3:11	The Lord is reserving this man in the outer countryj of Persia. 
3:12	This (is) his name: that sibor which (begins with) the letter K of the alphabet. 
3:13	And this man is coming to the Seven-hilled city toward the evening." 
3:14	And he will prepare for his enemies. 
3:15	And on Saturday0 morning, as the sun rises, he will engage in a great war with the nation1 and the sons of Hagar, both he andq the two small boys. 
3:16	And the rulers of the Romans will gather together in Byzantium. 
3:17	Then even the priests of the Romans and the bishops and abbots who are found will bear weapons of war. 
4:1	And when he has gathered those together with (the) two small boys, that king also will join in a mighty war with the nation of the sons of Hagar. 
4:2	And he will massacre them like the grass of a reed being burned by fire. 
4:3	And from their blood a three-year-oldc bull will drown. 
4:4	And the king alone will pursue a thousand and the two small boys myriads. 
4:5	And Ishmael and the sons of Hagar will be butchered to the end. 
4:6	And there will be war and great bloodshed such as has not been since the foundation of the world. 
4:7	The blood will be mixedf in the sea one and a half miles. 
4:8	And in the streets of the Seven-hilled (city) horses will be submerged, drowning in the blood. 
4:9	And from that nation and from Ishmael there will remain1 only three tents of men. 
4:10	And (the) sons of Ishmael will serve the Romans to the end and will serve the chief donkey drivers of the Seven-hilled (city for) thirty years. 
4:11	And the nature of Ishmael in the sword and in captivity is more bitter and more grievousk beyond that of the Romans.1 
4:12	And the Roman race will desire to seem a trace of Ishmael and will not find (it). 
4:13	And then the prophetic word will be fulfilled (that says): 
4:14	"How will one pursue a thousand and two remove myriads unlessu the Lord God rejected them and the Lord gave them over?" 
5:1	And the king of the Romans will subdue every enemy and adversary under his feet. 
5:2	And the scepter of that king will be long-lived, likewise (that) of the two small boys. 
5:3	And his fame will go forth from the east and the west. 
5:4	And there will be one empire. 
5:5	And no one will resist him because this man has come from God and he will cause alld war to cease. 
5:6	And there will be great peace. 
5:7	And every city and fortresses will be built. 
5:8	And there will be many altars acceptable to Gode in all the civilized world. 
5:9	And all the islandsf and the mountains will be inhabited. 
5:10	And the bread and the wine and the olive oil and the gold and the silver will increase in all the earth. 
5:11	And that king will cause all hostility to cease upon the earth. 
5:12	And they will make their weapons into scythes. 
5:13	And his reign will be (for) thirty-six years. 
5:14	And the rulers of the Romans will desirek to join in war but will not find (it). 
5:15	And all the perimeter(s) of the earth will fear them. 
5:16	And that king will glorify God because in his reign God gave to him the good things of the earth which he did not give since the foundation of the world. 
5:17	And is the king will fall asleep" in peace. 
5:18	And his two small boys will be taken up in peacep after thirty-three years. 
6:1	And after him there will arise from the north3 another king. 
6:2	And working great impurities and many injustices, he will also work great iniquities. 
6:3	And he will coupled mother and son and brother and sister. 
6:4	Ande he will bring the monks out of the holy monasteries and will join the monasteries together and will cause the nunsg to lie with his nation. 
6:5	And he will work great transgressions. 
6:6	Woe, woe then (to) the Christian race.

7:8	Churches will be destroyed. 
7:9	The faithb has been dissolved. 
7:10	Women conceive the babies of misbelievers.

7:12	And yourg high walls will fall. 
7:13	And there will remain in you only oneh pillar of Constantine the Great, so that they who sail the sea1 may lament there.

8:1	And another great scepter will arise from Judea. 
8:2	And his name (is) Dan.

8:5	And they will come into Jerusalem toward their king. 
8:6	And they will afflict the Christian race in alle the earth. 
8:7	Woe, woe good people. 
9:1	With him reigning, the Antichrist will go forth from the lower regions0 and the chasms of Hades. 
9:2	And he will come into a small garidionc fish. 
9:3	And he is coming in the broad sea. 
9:4	And he will be caughtd by twelve fishermen. 
9:5	And the fishermen will become maddenede toward each other.

9:26	And the A signifies: "I deny," the K: "And I completely reject," the T: "The befouled dragon." 
9:27	And the Antichrist will be teaching and being taught. 
10:1	At that time there will be an abundance of grain and wine and olive oil such as has not been since the foundation of the world. 
10:2	And in those times theb ear will pour out a half measure of grain.

11:10	And the people will be deadened. 
11:11	lf the just man is barely saved, how will the sinner appear?

12:2	And they will adhere to the Antichrist and they also will be tempting the Christians and killing'  the babies of the women. 
12:3	And they themselves will suckle from them. 
12:4	And then the people will be calling upon death and digging up the tombs and saying, 
12:5	"Blessed and thrice blessed are you who have already died, because you did not reach these days." 
12:6	And they who go down to the sea also (will be) saying, "May the fury of your waves swallow us also, OH holy sea." 
12:7	And then all flesh of the Romans will lament. 
12:8	And while there will be temporary1" joy and exultation of the Jews, (there will be) affliction and oppression of the Romans" from every necessity of the evil demons.

12:12	And the lakes and the rivers and the wells will dry up. 
12:13	And the moisture" of the waters will completely dry up. 
13:1	And then the Antichrist will lift up a stone in his hands and say, 
13:2	"Believe in me and I will make these stones (into) bread." 
13:3	And then (the) Jews will worship (him), who are saying, 
13:4	"You are Christ for whom we pray and on account of you the Christian race has grieved0 us greatly.', 
13:5:	And then the Antichrist will boast, saying to the Jews, 
13:6	"Do not be grieved thus. 
13:7	A little (while and) the Christian race will see and will realize who I am." 
13:8	And the Antichrist lifts up (his) voice toward thef flinty rock, saying," 
13:9	"Become bread before the Jews 
13:10	And disobeying him, the rock becomes a dragon. 
13:11	And the dragon says to the Antichrist, 
13:12	"Oh you who are full of every iniquity and injustice, why do you do things which you are not able?" 
13:13	And the dragon shames him before the Jews. 
14:1	And then three men will go forth and will condemn3 him (as) a liar and a deceiver. 
14:2	And these three men, two from heaven and one from the earth, also walk before the Antichrist and say  14:3	"Woe to you, O worker of injustice and inheritord of eternal fire." 
14:4	And they will walk in all the earth, crying out and saying to the afflicted Christians, 
14:5	"Hear Oh sons of men, and do not worship Ascenis him, because he is not the Christ nor a God-fearing man, but he is the Antichrist." 
14:6	And many Christians will run to the feet of the saints and say, 
14:7	"What shall we do, Oh saints? 
14:8	Where shall we Christians hide?" 
14:9	And many of the Christians will hide in mountains and caves and in the holes of the earth (and) will be saved, so that the treacherous Samuel' might not seize them. 
14:10	And when the Antichrist finds these three men he will kill them by the sword. 
14:11	Then that spoken by the prophet David will be fulfilled: 
14:12	"Then they will offer up bulls upon your altar" 
14:13	And with the Antichrist reigning and with the demons persecuting, the Jews contriving vanities against the Christians, the great day of the Lord draws near. 
14:14	And there will be judgment and recompense. 
14:15	And the deception of the devil will fall. 
14:16	And the light of the world, Christ our Lord" and king of glory, will flower, to whom is due all glory and honor and dominion forever. Amen.
